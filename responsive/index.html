                <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Joshua Joseph and I am currently going through a web development bootcamp through Northwestern University. 
                It's still within the first two weeks, but I am happy to finally persue a career in this field in a few short months. 
                Before this class I knew HTML and CSS. I am looking forward to learning these other things too: </p>
                <p>
                    <ul class="mainUL">
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>JQuery</li>
                        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>MySQL</li>
                        <li>SEO</li>
                        <li>BootStrap</li>
                        <li>And many others!</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                What do I like to do in my spare time, though? Video games, of course. 
                I have been in a top 200 world raiding guild for World of Warcraft, but have retired from that scene. 
                I have also become a grandmaster level player in Blizzard's other game: Overwatch. In World of Warcraft I played a warlock for about 7 years and in Overwatch, I main flex support, which means that I play characters like Moira, Zenyatta, and now Brigitte. 
                If I am not playing video games I am teaching myself how to play piano, which I can't wait to explore more.</p>
